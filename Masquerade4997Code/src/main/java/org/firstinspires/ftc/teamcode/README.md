Each Robot should be have a designated package within this folder.

Within each Robot Package should be 4 packages for organization:

# Autonomous
Within the Autonomous Folder should be every Autonomous used for competition.
This may include autonomous for Red and Blue sides, just parking, or different tasks depending on specific teams we are alliance partners with.

# Robot
Within this folder should be the Hardware class ands any subsystems of the robot.

# TeleOp
This folder should have every teleOp that will be used in competition, usually this just has one teleOp.
